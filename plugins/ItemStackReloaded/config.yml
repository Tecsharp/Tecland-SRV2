# Thank you for using my plugin Item Stack Reloaded
# - Xiztence
#
# Permissions: Give players "itemstackreloaded.use" to allow use of the command.
# 
# Per player permissions allow you to let some players stack certain items.
# Give a player the permission "itemstackreloaded.stack.<item>", e.g "itemstackreloaded.stack.LAVA_BUCKET" will allow stacking of lava buckets.
# A full list of item names can be found here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html
# OBS! For per player permissions to work, the player also needs the "itemstackreloaded.use" permission.
# Per player permissions:
per_item_perms: false

# How many items should a stack contain?
# WARNING - Do not set this number above 127.
# Use "stack-size: 0" for the default stack size of the respective item.
stack_size: 64

# A full list of item names can be found here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html
# Use the following format to define new items
special_size:
  'WATER_BUCKET': '16'
  'LAVA_BUCKET': '16'

# Optional - change the chat formatting
# Use <PERM> for permission node, e.g "You do not have the <PERM> permission to use this command"
# Use <TYPE> for itemtype, e.g "You have stacked all <TYPE> items."
